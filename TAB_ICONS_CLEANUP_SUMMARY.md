# Tab Icons Cleanup Summary

## Issue
Tab icons were appearing in both the header navigation AND section headers, creating visual duplication and confusion.

## Solution
Removed duplicate tab icons from all section headers while keeping them only in the main header navigation where they belong.

## Files Modified

### ✅ Section Headers - Icons Removed

1. **`src/components/features/ProductGridHeader.tsx`**
   - Removed Products icon from section header
   - Kept product count badges
   - Updated comment from "Products Icon" to "Product counts"

2. **`src/components/features/CustomersGridHeader.tsx`**
   - Removed Customers icon from section header
   - Kept customer count badges
   - Updated comment from "Customers Icon and Title" to "Customer counts"

3. **`src/components/features/OrdersGridHeader.tsx`**
   - Removed Orders icon from section header
   - Kept order count badges
   - Updated comment from "Orders Icon and Title" to "Order counts"

4. **`src/app/modules/media/MediaModule.tsx`**
   - Removed Media Manager icon from section header
   - Kept media count badges
   - Updated comment from "Media Icon and Stats" to "Media Stats"

5. **`src/app/modules/coa/CoaModule.tsx`**
   - Removed COA Manager icon from section header
   - Kept COA count badges
   - Updated comment from "COA Icon and Stats" to "COA Stats"

6. **`src/components/features/SettingsView.tsx`**
   - Removed Locations icon from section header
   - Kept location count badges
   - Updated comment from "Locations Icon and Count" to "Location counts"

### ✅ Header Navigation - Icons Preserved

The main header navigation (`src/components/layout/Header.tsx`) and tab bar (`src/components/ui/TabBar.tsx`) continue to show tab icons as intended.

### ✅ Appropriate Icons - Left Unchanged

- **`src/components/features/SalesByDayReport.tsx`** - Report icon kept (not a duplicate tab icon)
- **`src/components/features/ProductEditor.tsx`** - Internal tab icons kept (different context)
- **`src/components/features/product-settings/BlueprintDesigner.tsx`** - Internal tab icons kept (different context)

## Result

✅ **Tab icons now appear ONLY in the header navigation**
✅ **Section headers show clean count badges without duplicate icons**
✅ **Consistent visual hierarchy maintained across all views**
✅ **Professional, uncluttered interface**

## Views Cleaned Up

- Products view
- Customers view  
- Orders view
- Media Manager
- COA Manager
- Settings (Locations section)

The interface now has a clear visual separation:
- **Header navigation**: Shows tab icons for navigation
- **Section headers**: Show clean count badges and filters without duplicate icons

This creates a more professional and less cluttered user experience.
